# collmaps

![collmap](inst/rstudio/templates/project/biodiv.png)

The goal of collmaps is to provide simple tools to check plant collection records. It provides a user interface to upload an excel table that must have at least three columns with these names: ID, lat, and lon.



## Installation

You can install the released version of collmaps from github with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rsimon64/collmaps")
```

## Example

The interface can be started from the addin menu in RStudio or from the terminal:

```{r eval=FALSE}

collmaps::cm_map()

```
